      url
      defaultBranchRef {
        name
      }
      languages(first: 1, orderBy: { field: SIZE, direction: DESC }) {
        nodes {
          name
          color
        }
      }
    }
  }

```ts
import { gqlTyped } from "github-schema";
```

> You will need to have [GraphQL LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) installed, and have a `.graphqlrc.yaml` file in your project root.  
> If you also want nice colors, i would recommend [GraphQL Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax) installed.
